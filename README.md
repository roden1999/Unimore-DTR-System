This project is a full-stack React + Node.js application designed to read attendance logs directly from the Nideka NU-2302 biometric device and automate 
the computation of work hours.

It replaces the company’s old manual process of using a Bundy clock and encoding times into Excel. With this system, attendance data is pulled directly 
from the device, processed by the backend, and displayed cleanly in a modern web interface.
